/// A view that shows buttons that people tap to vote for their favorite pet,
/// arranged in a way that best fits available space.
///
/// The size of the voting buttons that this view displays depends on the width
/// of the text they contain. For people that speak another language or that
/// use a larger text size, the horizontal arrangement provided by the default
/// ``MyEqualWidthHStack`` layout might not fit in the display. So this view uses
/// [`ViewThatFits`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewthatfits)
/// to let SwiftUI choose between that and an alternative vertical arrangement
/// provided by the ``MyEqualWidthVStack`` layout:
///
/// ```swift
/// ViewThatFits { // Choose the first view that fits.
///     MyEqualWidthHStack { // Arrange horizontally if it fits...
///         Buttons()
///     }
///     MyEqualWidthVStack { // ...or vertically, otherwise.
///         Buttons()
///     }
/// }
/// ```

/// - Tag: ButtonStack

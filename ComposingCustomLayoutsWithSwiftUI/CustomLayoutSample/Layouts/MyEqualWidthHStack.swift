/// A custom horizontal stack that offers all its subviews the width of its
/// widest subview.
///
/// This custom layout arranges views horizontally, giving each the width needed
/// by the widest subview.
///
/// ![Three rectangles arranged in a horizontal line. Each rectangle contains
/// one smaller rectangle. The smaller rectangles have varying widths. Dashed
/// lines above each of the container rectangles show that the larger rectangles
/// all have the same width as each other.](voting-buttons)
///
/// The custom stack implements the protocol's two required methods. First,
/// ``sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:)`` reports the container's size,
/// given a set of subviews.
///
/// ```swift
/// let maxSize = maxSize(subviews: subviews)
/// let spacing = spacing(subviews: subviews)
/// let totalSpacing = spacing.reduce(0) { $0 + $1 }
///
/// return CGSize(
///     width: maxSize.width * CGFloat(subviews.count) + totalSpacing,
///     height: maxSize.height)
/// ```
///
/// This method combines the largest size in each dimension with the horizontal
/// spacing between subviews to find the container's total size. Then,
/// ``placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)`` tells each of the subviews
/// where to appear within the layout's bounds.
///
/// ```swift
/// let maxSize = maxSize(subviews: subviews)
/// let spacing = spacing(subviews: subviews)
///
/// let placementProposal = ProposedViewSize(width: maxSize.width, height: maxSize.height)
/// var nextX = bounds.minX + maxSize.width / 2
///
/// for index in subviews.indices {
///     subviews[index].place(
///         at: CGPoint(x: nextX, y: bounds.midY),
///         anchor: .center,
///         proposal: placementProposal)
///     nextX += maxSize.width + spacing[index]
/// }
/// ```
///

/// that, along with a point that changes for each subview, to arrange the
/// subviews in a horizontal line with default spacing.

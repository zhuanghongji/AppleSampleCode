import SwiftUI

/// A custom layout that arranges its views in a circle.
///
/// This container works as a general radial layout for any number of views.
/// If you provide exactly three views in the layout's view builder and give
/// the views rank values using the `Rank` view layout key, the layout rotates
/// the view positions so that the views appear in rank order from top to
/// bottom.
///
/// ![Three filled circles placed at equal distances along the outline of a
/// larger, empty circle. The outline of the larger circle uses a dashed
/// line.](avatars)
///
/// Like other custom layouts, this layout implements the two required methods.
/// For ``sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:)``, the layout fills the
/// available space by returning whatever size its container proposes.
/// The layout uses the proposal's
/// [`replacingUnspecifiedDimensions(by:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/proposedviewsize/replacingunspecifieddimensions(by:))
/// method to convert the proposal into a concrete size:
///
/// ```swift
/// proposal.replacingUnspecifiedDimensions()
/// ```
///
/// Then, in the ``placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)`` method, the
/// layout rotates a vector, translates the vector to the middle of the
/// placement region, and uses that as the anchor for the subview:
///
/// ```swift
/// for (index, subview) in subviews.enumerated() {
///     // Find a vector with an appropriate size and rotation.
///     var point = CGPoint(x: 0, y: -radius)
///         .applying(CGAffineTransform(
///             rotationAngle: angle * Double(index) + offset))
///
///     // Shift the vector to the middle of the region.
///     point.x += bounds.midX
///     point.y += bounds.midY
///
///     // Place the subview.
///     subview.place(at: point, anchor: .center, proposal: .unspecified)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The offset that the layout applies to the rotation accounts for the current
/// rankings, placing higher-ranked pets closer to the top of the interface. The
/// app stores ranks on the subviews using the
/// [`LayoutValueKey`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/layoutvaluekey)
/// protocol, and then reads the values to calculate the offset before placing
/// views.

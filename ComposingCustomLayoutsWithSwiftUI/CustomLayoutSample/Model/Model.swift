/// This model keeps a collection of ``Pet`` instances in the ``pets`` array.

/// get summary information about the collection, like the total
/// votes in the ``totalVotes`` property, and the rank of a specified pet
/// using the ``rank(_:)`` method.

/// To extend this app, you might share this model data in iCloud among a
/// group of your app's users.
